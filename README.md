# ShipsEar-An-Unofficial-Train-Test-Split
An unofficial train-test split for ShipsEar: An underwater vessel noise database

### Background
The ShipsEar dataset (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2016.06.008) is one of the most commonly used underwater noise databases and is widely used in the field of underwater acoustics.    
However, the official train-test split is not available, which prevents fair comparisons for many works.  
This repo is intended to provide an unofficial training-test split for works seeking fair comparisons and credible benchmarks.  

### Train-Test Split for 12 classes
